# Privacy Detection

## IP Addresses associated with identity hiding services such as VPN, Tor, Proxies, Relays and Hosting service.

# Database Schema & Description

*[data updated as of January, 2025]*

| Field Name  | Example             | Data Type | Descrption                                                           |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **network** | `146.70.174.112/31` | TEXT      | CIDR or IP network of the IP address block                           |
| **hosting** | `true`              | BOOLEAN   | Indicates a hosting/cloud service/data center IP address             |
| **proxy**   | `false`             | BOOLEAN   | Indicates a open web proxy IP address                                |
| **tor**     | `false`             | BOOLEAN   | Indicates a TOR (The Onion Router) exit node IP address              |
| **relay**   | `false`             | BOOLEAN   | Indicates Virtual Private Network (VPN) service exit node IP address |
| **vpn**     | `true`              | BOOLEAN   | Indicates location preserving anonymous relay service                |
| **service** | `ProtonVPN`         | TEXT      | Name of the anonymous IP service provider                            |

<summary><h3>Alternate Database Schema: <code>standard_privacy</code></h3></summary>

The `standard_privacy` data download is structured based on IP ranges (`start_ip` and `end_ip`) and includes the `join_key` column. Our default data downloads has been updated (January, 2025) to use the `network`-based schema which also does not include the `join_key` column. However, we will continue supporting the original IP range-based schema for existing customers, with no plans for deprecation. While the underlying data remains the same, the difference lies only in the schema.


| Field Name   | Example          | Data Type | Description                                                          |
|--------------|------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **start_ip** | `89.187.171.147` | TEXT      | Starting IP address of an IP address range                           |
| **end_ip**   | `89.187.171.147` | TEXT      | Ending IP address of an IP address range                             |
| **join_key** | `89.187.0.0`     | TEXT      | Special variable to facilitate databas `join` operation              |
| **hosting**  | `true`           | BOOLEAN   | Indicates a hosting/cloud service/data center IP address             |
| **proxy**    |                  | BOOLEAN   | Indicates a open web proxy IP address                                |
| **tor**      |                  | BOOLEAN   | Indicates a TOR (The Onion Router) exit node IP address              |
| **vpn**      | `true`           | BOOLEAN   | Indicates Virtual Private Network (VPN) service exit node IP address |
| **relay**    |                  | BOOLEAN   | Indicates location preserving anonymous relay service                |
| **service**  | `CyberGhost`     | TEXT      | Name of the anonymous IP service provider                            |


> Includes IP range columns (`start_ip` and `end_ip`) instead of a network or CIDR based column (`network`).
> `join_key` represents the Class C network each IP address is part of, allowing you to filter the result set significantly before `join`ing. Learn more about `join_key` [here](https://community.ipinfo.io/t/ipinfos-join-key-column-explained/5526).

The schema for Boolean values is different between these two databases.

| Boolean Value | standard_privacy | ipinfo_privacy |
