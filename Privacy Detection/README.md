# Privacy Detection

## IP Addresses associated with identity hiding services such as VPN, Tor, Proxies, Relays and Hosting service.

# Database Schema & Description

*[data updated as of August, 2022]*

The following database schema represents the CSV database. We also provide JSON and MMDB format data.

| Field Name | Example | Data Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `start_ip` | 115.9.76.79 | TEXT | Starting IP address of an IP address range |
| `end_ip` | 115.9.76.79 | TEXT | Ending IP address of an IP address range |
| `join_key` | 115.9.0.0 | TEXT | Special variable to facilitate join operation |
| `hosting` |  | BOOLEAN | Indicates a hosting IP address most of the time based on a datacenter. Indicative of bots, scrapers or malicious activities |
| `proxy` |  | BOOLEAN | Similar to VPN mainly used by businesses |
| `tor` |  | BOOLEAN | IP address originated from the Onion router |
| `vpn` | True | BOOLEAN | Virtual Private Network (VPN) service IP address |
| `relay` |  | BOOLEAN | Traffic relays often provided by CDN companies |
| `service` |  | TEXT | Name of the privacy service provider |

> `join_key` â†’ This key represents the Class C network each IP address is part of, allowing you to filter the result set significantly before filtering to the exact IP address you want. [[*Source*](https://ipinfo.io/blog/ingesting-ipinfo-geolocation-data-with-postgresql-13/)]
> 

IP address data like `start_ip`, `end_ip` and `join_key` should be assigned `inet` data type if you are ingesting the data in PostgreSQL.
