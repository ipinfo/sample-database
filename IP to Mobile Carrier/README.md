<summary><h3>Alternate Database Schema: <code>standard_carrier</code></h3></summary>

The `standard_carrier` data download is structured based on IP ranges (`start_ip` and `end_ip`) and includes the `join_key` column. Our default data downloads has been updated (January, 2025) to use the `network`-based schema which also does not include the `join_key` column. However, we will continue supporting the original IP range-based schema for existing customers, with no plans for deprecation. While the underlying data remains the same, the difference lies only in the schema.

| **end_ip**   | `5.208.203.255`                            | TEXT      | Ending IP address of an IP address range                 |
| **join_key** | `5.208.0.0`                                | TEXT      | Special variable to facilitate database `join` operation |

| **mcc**      | `432`                                      | TEXT      | Mobile Country Code (MCC) of the carrier                 |

> Includes IP range columns (`start_ip` and `end_ip`) instead of a network or CIDR based column (`network`).
> `join_key` represents the Class C network each IP address is part of, allowing you to filter the result set significantly before `join`ing. Learn more about `join_key` [here](https://community.ipinfo.io/t/ipinfos-join-key-column-explained/5526).
