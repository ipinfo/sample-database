## Get mobile carrier information (carrier, MCC, MNC) matched to IP addresses.

# Database Schema & Description

*[data updated as of August, 2022]*

The following database schema represents the CSV database. We also provide JSON and MMDB format data.

| Field Name | Example | Data Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `start_ip` | 5.208.203.0 | TEXT | Starting IP address of an IP address range |
| `end_ip` | 5.208.203.255 | TEXT | Ending IP address of an IP address range |
| `join_key` | 5.208.0.0 | TEXT | Special variable to facilitate join operation |
| `name` | Mobile Communication Company of Iran PLC | TEXT | Name of the mobile carrier |
| `country` | IR | TEXT | ISO 3166 country code |
| `mcc` | 432 | TEXT | Mobile Country Code (MCC) of the carrier |
| `mnc` | 11 | TEXT | Mobile Network Code (MNC) of the carrier |

> `join_key` â†’ This key represents the Class C network each IP address is part of, allowing you to filter the result set significantly before filtering to the exact IP address you want. [[*Source*](https://ipinfo.io/blog/ingesting-ipinfo-geolocation-data-with-postgresql-13/)]
> 

IP address data like `start_ip`, `end_ip` and `join_key` should be assigned `inet` data type if you are ingesting the data in PostgreSQL.
