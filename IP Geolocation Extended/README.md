# IP Geolocation Extended Database

## IP to Geolocation database with accuracy radius data as a confidence metric

This database provides IP geolocation data with an accuracy radius, which is the estimated distance between the actual location of the user (based on our ground truth daata) and the geolocation coordinates returned by the database. The accuracy radius varies depending on the city, country, connection type, and IP address type. The database also comes with the `geoname_id` field that provide additional geographic information from [geonames.org](https://www.geonames.org/).
