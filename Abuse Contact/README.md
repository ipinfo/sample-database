# Abuse Contact Database

## Abuse Contact database provides the contact information of all the ISPs to report hacking, spamming or other nefarious activities.

As of August, 2022 there are almost 33 million entries in the database containing IP address, name, and contact information of ISPs all over the world.

# Database Schema & Description

*[data updated as of August, 2022]*

The following database schema represents the CSV database. We also provide JSON and MMDB format data.

| Field Name | Example | Data Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `start_ip` | 119.93.20.248 | TEXT | Starting IP address of an IP address block |
| `end_ip` | 119.93.20.255 | TEXT | Ending IP address of an IP address block |
| `join_key` | 119.93.0.0 | TEXT | Special variable to make join operations incredibly fast. |
| `name` | Nilo Agir | TEXT | Name of the abuse contact |
| `email` | abuse@pldt.net | TEXT | Organizational email of the abuse contact |
| `address` | Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company, 6/... | TEXT | Organizational address of the abuse contact |
| `country` | PH | TEXT | ISO 3166 country code |
| `phone` | +632-584-1045 | TEXT | Organizational phone number of the abuse contact |

> `join_key` â†’ This key represents the Class C network each IP address is part of, allowing you to filter the result set significantly before filtering to the exact IP address you want. [[*Source*](https://ipinfo.io/blog/ingesting-ipinfo-geolocation-data-with-postgresql-13/)]
> 

IP address data like `start_ip`, `end_ip` and `join_key` should be assigned `inet` data type if you are ingesting the data in PostgreSQL.
