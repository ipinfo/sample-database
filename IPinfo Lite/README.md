# IPinfo Lite Database

## IPinfo's free IP datbaase that provides location (country + continent) and ASN information in a single database

The IPinfo Lite database is part of our [free IP data downloads offering](https://ipinfo.io/products/free-ip-database). The IPinfo Lite database is our ultimate free IP database combining both country and ASN information in a single database. Features of the IPinfo Lite database includes:

- Full accuracy with zero compromise. The dataset is updated daily to ensure the highest accuracy possible.
- The dataset is a merged subset of our premium [IP to Geolocation Database](https://ipinfo.io/products/ip-geolocation-database) and [ASN database](https://ipinfo.io/products/asn-database).
- It includes both IPv4 and IPv6 data in a single dataset.
- It includes both country and ASN information, which means that for each IP address query, you will receive both of these pieces of information.
- The data is tabular and unnested, making it extremely easy to use.
- Our free databases are licensed under CC-BY-SA 4.0.
- Comes in MMDB, CSV, and JSON formats.

<summary><h3>Alternate Database Schema: <code>country_asn</code></h3></summary>

The `country_asn` data download is structured based on IP ranges (`start_ip` and `end_ip`). Our default data downloads has been updated (January, 2025) to use the `network`-based schema and also changes the name of the columns. However, we will continue supporting the original IP range-based schema for existing customers, with no plans for deprecation. While the underlying data remains the same, the difference lies only in the schema.

| Field Name       | Example                      | Data Type | Description                                       |
|------------------|------------------------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `start_ip`       | 1.0.16.0                     | TEXT      | Starting IP address of an IP address range        |
| `end_ip`         | 1.0.31.255                   | TEXT      | Ending IP address of an IP address range          |
| `country`        | JP                           | TEXT      | ISO 3166 country code of the IP addresses         |
| `country_name`   | Japan                        | TEXT      | Name of the country                               |
| `continent`      | AS                           | TEXT      | Continent code of the country                     |
| `continent_name` | Asia                         | TEXT      | Name of the continent                             |
| `asn`            | AS2519                       | TEXT      | Autonomous System Number                          |
| `as_name`        | ARTERIA Networks Corporation | TEXT      | Name of the AS (Autonomous System) organization   |
| `as_domain`      | arteria-net.com              | TEXT      | Official domain or website of the AS organization |

> Includes IP range columns (`start_ip` and `end_ip`) instead of a network or CIDR based column (`network`).
