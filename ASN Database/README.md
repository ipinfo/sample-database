# ASN Database

## An Autonomous System Number (ASN) is a unique identifier given to a collection of IP networks by an organization. Get range, range type, and organization information from the ASN database.

> `join_key` represents the Class C network each IP address is part of, allowing you to filter the result set significantly before `join`ing. Learn more about `join_key` [here](https://community.ipinfo.io/t/ipinfos-join-key-column-explained/5526).

> Please refer to "[How to choose the best file format for your IPinfo database?](https://ipinfo.io/blog/ipinfo-database-formats/)" article to select the best format possible for your use case.
>
> The usage of the IP data downloads relies on the software or application of the data. Check out our [documentation](https://ipinfo.io/developers/database-download), [community](https://community.ipinfo.io/c/docs/8), and our [integrations](https://ipinfo.io/integrations) pages to find the best path forward.

Compared to the [IP to ASN (Free) Database](https://ipinfo.io/developers/ip-to-asn-database) or the [free IP to Country ASN database](https://ipinfo.io/developers/ip-to-country-asn-database), the [ASN database (Premium)](https://ipinfo.io/products/asn-database) is different because of certain factors. The [free IP to ASN database](https://ipinfo.io/developers/ip-to-asn-database) is a subset of the [ASN database (Premium)](https://ipinfo.io/products/asn-database) and does not contain the following information.

- **AS range type:** The `type` column in the ASN database is not available in the free ASN database. The `type` column provides insights into what type of organization is running a certain range of IP addresses. It could be one of four types: Education, Hosting, Business, or ISP. The range type is assigned based on a range classifier algorithm. Learn about the IPinfo range classifier algorithm [here](https://community.ipinfo.io/t/how-do-we-classify-asn-types/2236).
- **AS country type:** The `country` column in the ASN database is different from the `country` column in the free IP to Country ASN database. The `country` column is not present in the free IP to ASN database. The `country` column in the ASN database represents the country of the AS organization as represented in the WHOIS records. Meanwhile, the `country` column in the free IP to Country ASN database represents the geolocated country of ranges as per our IP to Geolocation data. It does not provide information regarding the organization's country, but rather the country of the ranges in general.

# ASN API

Along with our ASN database product, IPinfo also provides a robust API service. ASN data is available in two ways:
- [ASN information for an IP address](https://ipinfo.io/developers/data-types#asn-data)
- [ASN lookup](https://ipinfo.io/developers/asn)

The ASN API service is available as part of our [Basic Tier](https://ipinfo.io/developers/responses#basic-plan) plan.

## **ASN data from IP Address lookup**

You can get ASN level information of an IP address by looking up the IP address through [our API](https://ipinfo.io/developers/data-types#asn-data).

API Query:

```bash
$ curl ipinfo.io/$IP_ADDRESS/ASN?token=$TOKEN
```

Response:

```json
{
    "asn": "AS1221",
    "name": "Telstra Limited",
    "domain": "telstra.com.au",
    "route": "58.160.0.0/12",
    "type": "isp"
}
```

> We will also provide basic ASN information on our free and publicly accessible API service through the `org` field.

## **ASN data API**

You can get information on the ASNs themselves by looking up an ASN. Just prefix the `AS` keyword in front of the ASN (e.g. `AS12345`) and look it up on our [API endpoint](https://ipinfo.io/developers/asn).

```bash
$ curl ipinfo.io/$ASN?token=$TOKEN
```

Response:

```json
