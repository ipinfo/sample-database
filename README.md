## How to explore the sample databases

- Please visit the folders for each database. You can also find the API response samples there for each product.
- If you would like to explore CSV files, feel free to use any of these online services and import the raw CSV there -
    - [https://csvfiddle.io/](https://csvfiddle.io/)
    - [https://lite.datasette.io/](https://lite.datasette.io/)
- Or you can you just download the CSV files to take a closer look.
- You can also check out `.mmdb` sample files. Please use IPinfo's [mmdbctl](https://github.com/ipinfo/mmdbctl) tool to explore them.

## Usage Information

- After signing up for database downloads service, you can either download the database from our website or you can `curl` the database from the database download endpoint. But make sure you have redirect [enabled](https://ipinfo.io/faq/article/142-when-i-access-the-database-endpoint-using-something-like-curl-it-doesn-t-seem-to-work-and-i-get-a-corrupted-empty-file-what-am-i-doing-wrong).
- You can select how frequently the database gets updated. It can be daily, weekly, bi-weekly or monthly.
- To look up an specific database, you can use any kind of data exploration package or database system you want to use. [Here is an example](https://ipinfo.io/faq/article/144-how-do-you-do-a-lookup-of-an-ip-address-using-your-database) of using MySQL and PostgreSQL to look up a specific IP address.
