- Or you can you just download the CSV files to take a closer look.

### Usage Information

- After signing up for database downloads service, you can either download the database from our website or you can `curl` the database from the database download endpoint. But make sure you have redirect [enabled](https://ipinfo.io/faq/article/142-when-i-access-the-database-endpoint-using-something-like-curl-it-doesn-t-seem-to-work-and-i-get-a-corrupted-empty-file-what-am-i-doing-wrong).
- You can select how frequently the database gets updated. It can be daily, weekly, bi-weekly or monthly.
- To lookup an specific database you can use any kind of data exploration package or database system you want to use. [Here is an example](https://ipinfo.io/faq/article/144-how-do-you-do-a-lookup-of-an-ip-address-using-your-database) of using mySQL and PosgreSQL to lookup a specific IP address.
