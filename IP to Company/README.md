> `join_key` â†’ This key represents the Class C network each IP address is part of, allowing you to filter the result set significantly before filtering to the exact IP address you want. [[*Source*](https://ipinfo.io/blog/ingesting-ipinfo-geolocation-data-with-postgresql-13/)]

IP address data like `start_ip`, `end_ip` and `join_key` should be assigned `inet` data type if you are ingesting the data in PostgreSQL.
