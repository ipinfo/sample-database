| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `start_ip` | 125.113.0.0 | TEXT | Starting IP address of the ASN IP address block |
| `end_ip` | 125.113.255.255 | TEXT | Ending IP address of the ASN IP address block |

> `join_key` â†’ This key represents the Class C network each IP address is part of, allowing you to filter the result set significantly before filtering to the exact IP address you want. [[*Source*](https://ipinfo.io/blog/ingesting-ipinfo-geolocation-data-with-postgresql-13/)]
> 

IP address data like `start_ip`, `end_ip` and `join_key` should be assigned `inet` data type if you are ingesting the data in PostgreSQL.
