# Database Schema & Description

*[data updated as of August, 2022]*

The following database schema represents the CSV database. We also provide JSON and MMDB format data.

| Field Name | Example | Data Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ip` | 135.125.236.225 | TEXT | IP address for reverse IP lookup |
| `total` | 3 | INTEGER | Number of domains registered to the IP Address |
| `domains` | farmanaut.com,pharmanaut.be,farmanaut.be | TEXT | Name of the domain(s) under the IP address |

Each domain in the `domains` column is separated by a `,` (comma).

# API Response

As well as the database product, IPinfo also provides a robust API service. Please visit the [IPinfo Documentation](https://ipinfo.io/developers) portal to learn more.

Basic use case:

```bash
$ curl "ipinfo.io/domains/IP_ADDRESS?token=TOKEN"
```

This will return the full list of domains. So, if you are querying an IP address that hosts many domains, it is best to pipe the data to `less`

You can also limit the names of domains shown with the `limit` parameter.

```bash
curl "ipinfo.io/domains/IP_ADDRESS?token=TOKEN&limit=5"
```
