# Database Schema & Description

*[data updated as of May, 2024]*

The following database schema represents the CSV database. We also provide JSON and MMDB format data.

| Field Name | Example                                  | Data Type | Notes                                          |
|------------|------------------------------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------|
| `ip`       | 135.125.236.225                          | TEXT      | IP address for reverse IP lookup               |
| `total`    | 3                                        | INTEGER   | Number of domains registered to the IP Address |
| `domains`  | farmanaut.com,pharmanaut.be,farmanaut.be | TEXT      | Name of the domain(s) under the IP address     |

Each domain in the `domains` column is separated by a `,` (comma).

The Hosted Domains database contains domains that are hosted on a web server IP address, cached in a CDN server IP address, and the IP address that domain finally redirects to.
