# IP Geolocation Database

## Geolocation data such as city, region, country, location, timezone etc. identified from IP address.

# Database Schema & Description

*[data updated as of August, 2022]*

The following database schema represents the CSV database. We also provide JSON and MMDB format data.

| Field Name | Example | Data Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `start_ip` | 1.253.242.0 | TEXT | Starting IP address of an IP address range |
| `end_ip` | 1.253.242.255 | TEXT | Ending IP address of an IP address range |
| `join_key` | 1.253.0.0 | TEXT | Special variable to facilitate join operation |
| `city` | Yangsan | TEXT | City of the location |
| `region` | Gyeongsangnam-do | TEXT | Region of the location |
| `country` | KR | TEXT | ISO 3166 country code |
| `latitude` | 35.34199 | FLOAT | Latitude value of the location |
| `longitude` | 129.03358 | FLOAT | Longitude value of the location |
| `postal_code` | 50593 | TEXT | Postal code of the region. This is not the same as zip code. |
| `timezone` | Asia/Seoul | TEXT | Local time zone |

> `join_key` â†’ This key represents the Class C network each IP address is part of, allowing you to filter the result set significantly before filtering to the exact IP address you want. [[*Source*](https://ipinfo.io/blog/ingesting-ipinfo-geolocation-data-with-postgresql-13/)]
> 

IP address data like `start_ip`, `end_ip` and `join_key` should be assigned `inet` data type if you are ingesting the data in PostgreSQL.
