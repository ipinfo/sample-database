# IP Geolocation Database

## Get location data such as zipcode, city, region, country, location, timezone etc. of IP addresses.

Our IP geolocation data is our primary data product and is considered one of the best in the industry. We operate a large scale network infrastructure consisting of hundreds of servers around the world through which we take active network measurements over the entire internet ecosystem. Through our active measurement, we produce reliable and accurate IP geolocation data. You can learn more about our network from this article:[Probe network - how we make sure our data is accurate](https://ipinfo.io/blog/probe-network-how-we-make-sure-our-data-is-accurate/).
