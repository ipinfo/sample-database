## Legacy IP Database Downloads

IPinfo recommends that new users avoid the following legacy IP database downloads. We now offer multi-contextual IP databases that provide a richer mix of IP context in a single data package.

**User Question: I want city-level information on IP addresses. Should I choose IPinfo Core or the IP Geolocation Database?**

You should choose the IPinfo Core database. It includes detailed location information, such as city-level data, and network flags that provide valuable geolocation context. For example, carrier IPs often have lower geolocation confidence, and anonymous IP addresses are used by VPN services. This context is not available in single-context IP geolocation data.

**User Question: I want confident, accurate insights. Which database should I choose?**

Choose IPinfo Plus. It combines the reliability of the IP Geolocation Extended database with additional insightful IP geolocation data.

**User Question: I want to mix X IP insights with Y IP insights.**

Review the offerings in Lite, Core, Plus, and other options first. While we can provide custom database solutions, standard off-the-shelf data solutions are more accessible and require less engineering investment. Custom solutions are available if needed.
